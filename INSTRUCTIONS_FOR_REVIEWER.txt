TOY PROBLEMS

To reproduce the results shown in the top row of Fig. 6, follow these steps:

    1. Execute the "RS_comparison_variables.py" script.
       A folder named "nvariable_1hconf_nonlin_1000_1000_0_0.5" will be created inside the "results" folder.
       After the script finishes execution, you will find JSON dictionaries named after the system configuration
       (e.g., 7.json) in the "nvariable_1hconf_nonlin_1000_1000_0_0.5" folder.

    2. Run the "res_statistics.py" script to generate the plots.
       Note: Uncomment lines 200 and 201, and comment out lines 205-206.

To reproduce the results shown in the bottom row of Fig. 6, follow these steps:

    1. Execute the "RS_comparison_nconfounded.py" script.
       A folder named "nconfounded_nonlin_1000_1000_0_0.5" will be created inside the "results" folder.
       After the script finishes execution, you will find JSON dictionaries named after the system configuration
       (e.g., 2.json) in the "nconfounded_nonlin_1000_1000_0_0.5" folder.

    2. Run the "res_statistics.py" script to generate the plots.
       Note: Comment out lines 200 and 201, and uncomment lines 205-206.

CAUSAL WORLD

To reproduce the graph in Fig. 7, you can execute the "CW_analysis.py" script. This script performs 
causal discovery analysis on the Causal World data located in the "CW_data" folder. It will create 
a "CW_result" folder within the "results" folder, which contains three subfolders:

    1. "fpcmci": contains results of causal analysis performed on observational data with 
       all variables observable. The causal graph shown in the "ts_dag" figure corresponds 
       to the left side of Fig. 7.

    2. "fpcmci_hc": contains results of causal analysis performed on observational data with
       the height H hidden. The causal graph shown in the "ts_dag" figure corresponds to the
       center of Fig. 7.

    3. "candoit": contains results of causal analysis performed by CAnDOIT using both observational
       and interventional data with the height H hidden. The causal graph shown in the "ts_dag"
       figure corresponds to the right side of Fig. 7.
